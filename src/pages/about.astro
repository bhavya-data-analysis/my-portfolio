        <h1>About</h1>

        <p style="margin-top: 24px;">
          I’m an international graduate student in the United States with a
          strong focus on data analysis and machine learning, particularly where
          technical work directly supports decision-making.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
          My interests lie in building clean, reproducible data pipelines,
          developing interpretable models, and evaluating systems using metrics
          that actually matter — not just accuracy, but reliability, trade-offs,
          and real-world constraints.

        <h2>How I Approach Problems</h2>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>
          I approach data problems by first understanding the decision being
          supported. From there, I focus on selecting the right features,
          choosing models that balance performance and interpretability, and
          validating results through proper evaluation techniques.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
          Rather than chasing complex architectures by default, I prioritize
          strong baselines, transparent assumptions, and models that can be
          explained to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
