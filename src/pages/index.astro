        <p>
          I work at the intersection of data analysis and applied machine
          learning, focusing on problems where metrics matter — from statistical
          analysis and KPI tracking to classification performance and model
          reliability.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
          My projects emphasize reproducible pipelines, clean feature
          engineering, and systems that can be realistically evaluated,
          explained, and deployed in practical settings.
